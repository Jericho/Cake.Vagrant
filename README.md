## Getting started

You can find documentation either on [Cake's site](https://cakebuild.net/dsl/vagrant) or [here on GitHub](https://cake-contrib.github.io/Cake.Vagrant/). This should be enough to get started with Vagrant assuming you're familiar with the CLI.

You may find Vagrant's documentation helpful as well, both the [Command line](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli/) and [Getting started](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/) guides.

## Sample script

```
Task("Usage")
    .Does(() => {
        Vagrant.Init("hashicorp/precise64");
        Vagrant.Up(s => s.UseProvider("virtualbox"));
        Vagrant.Suspend();
    });

Task("Destroy")
    .Does(() => {
        Vagrant.Destroy();
        DeleteFile("Vagrantfile");
    });
```
